# 🚀 Introducing the Manchester United Dashboard: Web Scraping to Data Visualization 📊

Hey fellow Manchester United fans and data enthusiasts! Are you tired of scouring the web for the 
latest stats and updates on our beloved club? Look no further! I'm thrilled to present the Manchester United Dashboard,
a project that combines **the power of web scraping with dynamic data visualization** to bring you insights and analysis of Manchester United's performance.

## What's the Manchester United Dashboard?
The Manchester United Dashboard is a web application that harnesses the power of Looker's data 
visualization platform to provide fans with an immersive and interactive experience. 
By combining Looker's intuitive interface with the latest batch data scraped from various online sources, 
including official club websites, news articles, and social media platforms, the dashboard offers a comprehensive overview 
of Manchester United's performance, match analysis, player statistics, and much more.
