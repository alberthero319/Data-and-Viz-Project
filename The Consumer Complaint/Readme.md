# The Consumer Complaint
This data analysis and visualization was carried out in order to gain insight from the government regarding consumer complaints about financial services.
I was use a public dataset from [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/).
This database is not a statistical sample of consumers’ experiences in the marketplace. Complaints are not necessarily representative of all consumers’ experiences, and complaints do not constitute "information" for purposes of the Information Quality Act. The Bureau publishes the consumer’s narrative description of his or her experience if the consumer opts to share it publicly and after the Bureau removes personal information.

I am used Google BigQuery to gather the data and Looker Studio (Google DataStudio) to visualize the data into an insightful dashboard.
